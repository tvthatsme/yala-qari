# Yalla Qari

Yalla Qari translates to 'let\'s go reader!' in Arabic.

I am in the beginning stages of learning Arabic and noticed
that I have a hard time reading through words quickly. In my
native language, English, I can normally read the first letter
of a word along with the last, and quickly skim the word for meaning.
In this way I can quickly read through words on the basis of just
being so familiar with them.

I want to learn Arabic this way.

## Why an App

I was thinking about putting together all the Arabic words that I knew
and randomizing them into a paragraph for reading. My thought was that
maybe in practicing in this way I would be able to improve my learning.
